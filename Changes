Version 0.25, updates by Duncan Lamb and Lee Goddard:

	* The character "~" in the URL would confuse the "abs_url"
	subroutine, resolving "http://www.o.com/~home/page.html" to
	"http://www.o.com". It doesn't any more.
	* Double obliques in a link would cause an endless loop - no longer.
	* A link refrencing its own directory with "./" would also cause an
	endless loop - but no more.
	* "EXTENSIONS_BAD" list added.
	* "NEWNAMES" updated.
	* Frame parsing.
	* Multiple minimum-paths for URLs added.
